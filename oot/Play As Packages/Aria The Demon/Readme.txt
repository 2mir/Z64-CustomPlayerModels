Background:
This model was once set to be used in an indie game that never came out from a company that is all  but defunct.
Luckily I own the rights and decided instead of sitting on it i let the oot community enjoy it.
This might be used for additional mods in the future but is considered an open source model at this point.

The character in the original game was a part human part demon hybrid called a "Spirikin". Spirikins had all
the evil parts bread out thousands of years from the start of her adventure leaving a adept warrior race.
She was also the last of her kind until Chichi was born probably at the end of her adventure (if I remember
correctly). The clothing she wears is made of an alloy that hardens on metal inpact giving it a shean, yes that
is why it uses enviroment mapping.

Due to it using almost all of F3DZEX's Features This model is often used as a render accuracy test as well.
This model was designed with the N64's Reality Co Proccessor (specifically the Reality Display Proccessor
Part of the chip) in mind from the startm even when the game was planned for retail. It does work on metal
(Genuine Sgi/Nintendo hardware).

This is easily one of the more compilcated zzplayas models to be converted which is why theres a specific
model dedicated to ooto. This also has some animation edits to compinsate for her thin frame compared to link.

Costumes.

After ooto was made aware to me i created 2 additional costumes. To select them simply edit the config.

0 - Normal

The base model.

1 - A Swimsuit model

A costume inspired by Kasumi (Misty) from the game Pokemon

2 - Chichi

This is what Chichi (Aria's Daughter) would look like grown up
